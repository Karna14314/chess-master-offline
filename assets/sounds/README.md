# Sound Assets

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `move.mp3` - Standard move sound
- `capture.mp3` - Piece capture sound
- `check.mp3` - Check sound
- `game_end.mp3` - Game over sound
- `game_start.mp3` - Game start sound
- `low_time.mp3` - Low time warning

You can use free chess sound effects from:
- Lichess (CC0 license): https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/tree/master/public/sound
- Freesound.org
- Or record your own

For now, the app will continue to work without sounds if these files are missing.
